# Why?

Well, there's (sometimes) (rarely) genuinely heartfelt human interaction happening there, and the thought of it disappearing into the digital void makes me sad.

# That's all nice and good, but what's the actual reason?

The primary reason behind this is to use the collected data for creating statistics and visualizations, such as word cloud maps and other fun stuff. It's all about turning the raw conversations into meaningful insights and fun charts! :D
